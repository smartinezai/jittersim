# Changelog

Every JitterSim release. The newest is first. `scripts/release.sh` adds each
section from GitHub's generated release notes, and the same section travels
inside the signed release archive so the Pi can show it before installing.
Changes merged after the newest release are listed under Unreleased until the
next release takes them over.

## Unreleased

- Applying a profile to one connected device while a profile for Everyone runs now
  starts it for that device. The device leaves Everyone and runs its own profile,
  and Everyone keeps running for every other device. Before, the dashboard refused
  with "Everyone uses ... right now". It is refused while Everyone is saved but not
  the profile that runs. A failed start changes nothing. Start, Apply to all, Stop
  for everyone, Reset network and Panic end it for every device. The change adds a
  table to the settings database and needs the Pi helper restarted with the update.
- The Pi Wi-Fi follows the router. After a **Copy router Wi-Fi to Pi** that
  worked, the Pi records the router's Wi-Fi name and security (no password).
  Every boot renames a saved Wi-Fi with another name, such as
  `JitterSim-Recovery`, back to the router name. The router is not contacted.
  If the router name does not start, the previous name comes back for that
  boot. A manual Wi-Fi change or a name reset stops the following.
  `sudo /opt/jittersim/.venv/bin/python -m jittersim.networking.wifi_follow`
  `recovery` holds Recovery across reboots, `router` returns now and `status`
  names the state.
- `sudo jittersim update` and `jittersim remote update now` report success only
  when their install request reached `complete` and the Pi runs the new
  version. A rollback is reported only when the Pi confirmed it.
- A failed check on GitHub is an error instead of "Up to date".
- `sudo jittersim update --yes` and `--offline` work. An update that is already
  running is followed instead of started again, and under `--yes` a release
  that just failed is not installed again.
- `jittersim remote update now` follows an install the Pi already started when
  Install automatically is on, and `--json` prints one JSON answer.
- The dashboard asks before deleting a profile, device or group, clearing the
  activity log, importing settings, changing the Pi Wi-Fi, restoring its name,
  reversing an address move, copying the router Wi-Fi, removing dashboard
  access or stopping protection of the device in use in its own dialog instead
  of the browser's. The dialog names the action on its button, Escape
  cancels it and focus returns to the control that opened it.
- A screen reader hears each result once. The dashboard has one status region
  and one alert region for results and errors, and lists that refresh every few
  seconds (devices, saved profiles, groups, schedules, timers, limits,
  observations and the router connection) no longer announce themselves. A
  refresh keeps keyboard focus on the button you were on.
